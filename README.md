Uses unity version 6000.0.43f1

This is a cleaned up version of the original mobotic repo

TODO:

Create a few different vehicles (forklift, omnidirectional with hinge joints, 4 wheel steer, ect) and create different custom controllers for each

Fix left side mirrored parts having wrong wheel spin direction

Work on making it closer to 1:1 real world physics

Forklift not working great

Add back map selector, vehicle selector, menu system

mass in kg removal. Use built in rigidbody mass and drag for that stuff. simplify

more wheel rotational drag. More realistic forces like that
